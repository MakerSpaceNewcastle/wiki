# Code of Conduct

We expect all members, guests and attendees of events to abide by the following policy at  Maker Space and all its online meeting places.

Maker Space intends to provide everyone a harassment-free environment, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We want the space to be a safe space for everyone, and will not tolerate harassment in any form.

Harassment includes (but isn’t limited to) offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, mental health, race, religion; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; and inappropriate or unrequested photography or recording; sustained disruption of events; or any action that makes another member uncomfortable.

Anyone asked to stop any harassing behaviour, by anyone, is expected to do so immediately.

If you act or speak in a way that someone thinks is inappropriate, it’s inappropriate. If somebody tells you that you are making them uncomfortable, you must stop making them uncomfortable. Do not put your opinions or desires before the comfort of others; “It’s just a bit of fun”, “It’s just a joke”, “Where’s the harm in it?” (and so forth) are not excuses for behaviour that makes anyone else feel unwelcome or as if they are a target. If you feel compelled to tell someone who is uncomfortable that they are wrong to feel that way, you are most definitely putting yourself in the wrong.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please don’t ignore it. If you feel that you can, challenge the behaviour directly.
If you can’t do that, please contact the Board Members. If the offender is a Board Member, you can contact another Board Member directly.

If anyone engages in harassing behaviour, the Board Members may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or starting the Grievance Procedure.
