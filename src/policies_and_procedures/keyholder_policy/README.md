# Keyholder Policy

Being a keyholder is a responsibility.
You are expected to open up for other members and are responsible for the safety of the space when you do.
Every member does not have an automatic right to become a keyholder.

When you are an active keyholder you are responsible for the space and all that goes on within it.
You are responsible for the safety of others and the safety of yourself.
You may have to deal with incidents, accidents and medical emergencies.
Keys will only be granted if members believe you are able to cope with this.

If you are the active keyholder you must not leave the space until you have clearly handed over to another keyholder.
The space can not be left unlocked without a current keyholder in the building.

Keys will only be granted if at least three current keyholders can vouch for the honesty or safety of the applicant.
Any rejection should not be considered an insult but the applicant should take any reason(s) for rejection seriously and try to address them if they can.

We have no set duration you need to be a member before you can ask for a key but the applicant needs to know other keyholders well enough for them to be proposed and seconded.
Three months from a member who attends once a week, or a year for a member who attends once a month is a good guide to the minimum duration.
Not knowing the applicant enough is the top reason for applications being rejected.

A keyholder has the right to ask a member not to do something or to leave the building.
Keyholders do not have any other authority granted to them by being a keyholder.
A keyholder is not of a higher standing than any other member.

A key can be relinquished by the keyholder or withdrawn by the board at any time.
If a key has been relinquished the member they will need to reapply for practical reasons but there experience of being a keyholder is likely to result in most applications being fast tracked.

A keyholder is required to undergo an induction and sign the keyholder agreement before receiving a key.
The keyholder must be subscribed to the Maker Space admin email list.
All important keyholder messages will have a subject starting “Keyholders”.
The keyholder may be required to undergo refresher inductions in time to remain a keyholder.
