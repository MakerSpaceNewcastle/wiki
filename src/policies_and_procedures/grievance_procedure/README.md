# Grievance Procedure

## Intention

The Board Members of Maker Space have the authority to ban anyone from entering the space and the authority to strip anyone of their membership, or remove keyholder status.
This must only be done in circumstances where this authority is best for the Maker Space and its members as a whole.

This policy will only be applied to members who demonstrate unwillingness to address behaviour which has caused offence, harm or distress to another member or members; or has threatened the safety of the space. This may be behaviour directly targeting or witnessed by any individual.
The Maker Space Safe Spaces policy elaborates on this somewhat. 
Throughout the process, all efforts will be made to keep clear and constructive communication between the Board Members, the offending party, and any other affected parties.

In very serious cases, Board Members may invoke temporary access bans until the issue is resolved.


## Introduction

This policy applies to members, guests and attendees of events that use Maker Space or its online meeting places.
Any person may be banned from the space if they violate existing policies or if they have the potential to harm other users of the space.
Before the formal banning procedure is started, the Board Members must make every attempt to resolve the issue informally.


## Process

Should a Board Member become the focus of a complaint, they will not be included in their normal capacity during the grievance process.

The offending party must be given at least two written warnings before being banned. At every stage, it must be made clear to the party where they are in this process.

At every stage, all involved Board Members but one must be in agreement that allowing the user to continue to use the space would not be in the best interest of the organisation.

At every stage, the Board Members must make their reasoning available to the offending party. They must also make as much detail as is appropriate available to all members.

By default, a ban will be for a year. At their discretion, the Board Members can issue a reduced ban period.

Bans of more than one year may only be issued in extreme circumstances.
The Board Members must review these bans yearly.

If the offending party is a member, the ban will trigger the process to ternimate the offending person's membership as per the articles.

When a person is banned, their right to access Maker Space is revoked.
Any entry to the space without the prior, express permission of Board Members will be considered trespass.

The Board Members must seek feedback from the community to ensure this process remains fair and balanced.
