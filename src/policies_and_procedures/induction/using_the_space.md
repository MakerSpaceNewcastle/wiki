# Using the Space


## People use the space differently, please be considerate.
- Avoid telling people how to do their project.  Sometimes the objective is to learn a new technique rather than solve the problem in the best way.
- Try not to touch or pick up projects without permission.
- Some people are here to be social, some people are here to work and may not want to talk. Please respect their space and leave them be!


## Infrastructure/security
- While many things are fair game for hacking/modifying, the core infrastructure/access control systems are not.
- Attempts to 'defeat' security/access control for equipment will be viewed very negatively and may end up in restriction/removal of space access privileges.
- If you want to improve a piece of core infrastructure e.g. music player etc, then discuss any proposed changes with its' current owner/maintainer first.


## Parts/Materials
- We have lots of scraps, off-cuts, spares and components etc. which can be used.
- If you need something specific or a lot of something, please provide your own.


## Maker Space has a clean desk policy
- Try to tidy up as you go if possible.  Work spaces should be clean and tidy before you leave.
- If you need to leave something out, ask on the discussion list.
- Bins, dustpans, brushes, mops, blue roll and vacuum cleaners etc. are around the space.
- If you have cut, sawed, drilled, sanded, filed or ground anything then there will be something to clean up.
 

## Bins
- Large bins in the workshops - Dustpans and brushes attached.
- Small bins around the space.
- Please do not leave food waste in the space.
- Bins currently to be taken home.  Please help out if you can.
- Battery disposal - Please take to a battery recycling point e.g. Tesco.
- Recycling - Clean/Dry items that could go in a household recycling bin.
- Ensure cans are empty and not likely to leak in someone's car
- soft plastics/films if marked with "Recycle at Store"
- No electronics/e-waste
