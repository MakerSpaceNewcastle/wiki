# Introduction

Maker Space is a community owned and run working space. We've all clubbed together to get a space to work in. There aren't any grownups looking after this place, its just us, and it works because everyone pulls their weight to keep it running and nice for us all.


## If in doubt, ask the mailing list. 
- It can be found on the website header -> discussion list
- There is also a private list for members which is for the running of the space. You should have been added to this when you became a member - if not, please say something as you'll be missing out on key announcements. 
 

## Access to the space  
- Access is available if a keyholder has opened the space. i.e. Welcome Wednesday and regular evening sessions.
- If you need access outside of the normal hours, ask on the discussion list as a keyholder may be planning to be in.


## RFID Access 
- RFID fobs can be used to access:
    - The space, when a keyholder is in.
    - Machines that require an induction.
- If you have a compatible fob already, you can use that.  We also have some fobs available if you don't. 
- Register your fob by swiping the main door a few times and letting an admin know when you did it.
 

## General Safety
- Fire exits - keep clear! / Fire Extinguishers / First Aid Kit
- Be mindful of smoke alarms.
- What to do it fire alarm goes off - muster outside - if you find a fire, sound the alarm, yell etc, then leave.
- Fire assembly point is in the car park at the back of the building.
- Don't leave things on the floor where people might trip over them, bags, cables, project boxes etc, tripping over hurts
- Use ladders when required rather than chairs, tables etc. and make sure it's stable.
- Be mindful of others if you're doing something that might impact on them or if they might. e.g. working in doorways, walkways etc.
- Do not work on live mains electricity, it's quite dangerous.
 

## Toilets / Water / Drainage
- Toilets near entrance. 
- Drinking water from Kitchen.
- If you're covered in oil or grease, cleaning supplies (Swarfega etc.) are available. - Currently downstairs by the lathe.
