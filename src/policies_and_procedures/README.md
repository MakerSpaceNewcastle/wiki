# Policies and Procedures

This section describes how Maker Space is managed.

## New Members

When joining Maker Space, new members start by filling in an application form which can be found here: [https://www.makerspace.org.uk/joinus/](https://www.makerspace.org.uk/joinus/)

The [New Member Procedure](./new_member_procedure/) explains the process in more detail.

The last step of becoming a member of Maker Space is to go through a general [induction](./induction/).
This covers the basic health and safety points, where to find things, what to expect of the space and what we expect of you.

## Making changes in the space

Maker Space members are welcome to make and suggest changes in the space. 
We have a [Change Proposal Procedure](./proposals/) for proposing and making changes in the space.

## Becoming a Keyholder

Most Maker Space members are keyholders, giving them 24hr access to the space.
Our [Keyholder Policy](./keyholder_policy/) outlines what we expect of you as a keyholder.

To become a keyholder, you must be sponsored and seconded by existing keyholders and go through the [Keyholder Proposal Procedure](./keyholder_proposal/).

## Behaviour Policies

Please, just be nice.  We don't want to have to use our [Code of Conduct](./code_of_conduct/) or our [Grievance Procedure](./grievance_procedure/).
