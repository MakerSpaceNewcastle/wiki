# Waste Streams

We produce some waste in Maker Space, this needs to be removed to keep the space tidy.
The building does not have a commercial waste collection, so waste must be removed by members.

## Disposal streams

### General waste

There are several general waste bins throughout the space.
Unless a bin is labelled otherwise, assume it is for general waste.

Anything placed in these bins will likely end up in landfill.

### Common recycling

There are recycling bins near the door to the goldfish bowl in the main space.
These are clearly labelled.
Please READ THE LABELS, and put things in the correct state in the correct bins.

### Wood

There is a box on the floor to the left of the laser cutter for wood waste.
This is taken to a recycling centre and likely ends up in an incinerator.

Use this for scraps that are likely to no longer be of use.

### E-waste

There is a box on the floor to the left of the laser cutter for e-waste.
This is taken to a recycling centre and might be recycled to some extent, maybe.

This may be used for small items of e-waste created in the space.
If you would otherwise throw stuff in general waste you may bring things in to be correctly disposed of if you are not able to take them to an appropriate recycling centre yourself (but do not take the piss).

### PLA

There is a red sweet box on the 3D printing station where scraps of PLA can be deposited and shipped away for recycling.
Ensure only PLA goes into this container.

You may also drop unwanted or failed PLA prints into this box.

### Batteries

There is a small tub near the common recycling bins that expired single use batteries can be left in.
Should this tub be full, please take the contents to [Tesco (or your major supermarket of choice)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consumer-products-recycling-batteries-and-electrical-waste) where they should have a bin to recycle them.

Other batteries (i.e. those you cannot take to a supermakret) should be taken home and disposed of yourself.

### Anything else?

Anything not explicitly listed above that needs to be disposed of must be taken out of the space by whoever created the waste.

## Reuse streams

### Wood

There are several bins in the south basement workshop for wood scraps.

They are for scraps that may be of use for shims, sacrificial parts/supports, push sticks, paint stirrers, etc.

Please be reasonable about what will actually be useful, keep only things that have a realistic chance of being used and place other scraps in the [wood disposal bin](#wood).

### Laser suitable materials

There is a large box on the table next to the laser cutter where material offcuts that may still be of some use may be left.

Suitable scraps include:

- small sections which may be used for inductions
- moderately sized sections which may be enough for small jobs
- unusual materials that others may want to try before committing to purchasing

Again, be realistic about what is useful.
Anything smaller than 40mm in any dimension is unlikely to be used (unless it is an unusual material).
