# Hack or Die

In the ground floor corridor there are a set of blue shelves; this is the hack or die.
A treasure trove of random stuff looking for a new home.

Anything that is unwanted, yet not obviously rubbish can be placed here.

Anyone who would like the item, for whatever reason, may take it.
Once an item has been taken, it cannot be returned, it is now yours.

Anything that has not been claimed in a reasonable amount of time (around a few weeks) should be disposed of appropriately.
