# Member Storage

## Member boxes

Each makerspace member is welcome to store their personal equipment/projects in a project box on the Member Shelves.  These are situated in the ground floor workshop along the back wall.

You should use a 32 litre 'underbed storage box' with lid, so that it will fit neatly on the shelves.  These are available from retailers like B&M (£5 or 2 for £8 as of 06/2025).

## Larger items

We recognise from time to time people might need to **temporarily** have larger project items in the space when they are being worked on.

If you think this applies to you, you should ask via one of the [communications channels](./communications) **before** bringing in any project that doesn't fit in your member storage box.
