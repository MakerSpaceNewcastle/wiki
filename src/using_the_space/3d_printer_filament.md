# 3D Printer Filament

Maker Space has a stock of filament that may be used for printing in the space.

## The Maker Space filament stock

Any filament in the following locations is to be considered part of the Maker Space filament stock:

- in the cardboard box under the desk with the Bambu Lab printers on
- loaded in the AMS of either [Bambu Lab printer](../equipment/bambulab_p1s) (when no job is running)
- loaded in the external filament spool on [Kirisame](../equipment/bambulab_p1s) (when no job is running)
- loaded in the [Prusa Mk3](../equipment/prusa_mk3) or on its spool holder (when no job is running)

> The current price for filament from the Maker Space stock is Â£0.012 per gram.

## Accounting

- Your filament consumption should be taken from the estimation made by the appropriate slicer
- Should a print fail, you should pay the best approximation possible of the consumed filament
- There is not currently any centralised recording of print jobs, you are expected to do your own accounting of your consumption
- Payments to the space should be clearly indicated that they are for filament

## Donating filament

Members may donate filament to the Maker Space filament stock, in which case the following rules apply:

- the filament must be suitable for use in the Maker Space printers and its material clearly identified
- the member who donated the filament may use it at zero cost
- all other members may use it, and pay the above rate to do so

## Personal filament

Members may use their own filament in the Maker Space printers, in which case the following rules apply:

- filament should be unloaded when printing is complete
- filament should be kept in the member's storage box or brought in as required (i.e. not left somewhere where it would be assumed to be part of the Maker Space stock)
