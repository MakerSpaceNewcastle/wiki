## Maker Space Member list

There is a members list all members are subscribed to during the sign up process.
Ask if you are a member and have not already been added.

It is used to discuss around, make decisions about the space operation and notify of updates to machine maintenance and the space in general.
As a member, you are expected to keep an eye on emails on this list as they may contain important information about the space.
