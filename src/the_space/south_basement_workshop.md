Here, we present a non-functioning CNC milling machine, awaiting the touch of a skilled hand to restore it to its former glory.
The machine boasts a solid and durable construction, designed to handle heavy-duty tasks once operational.

The plastic bins harbor an orchestra of fasteners.
Hex nuts, wing nuts, carriage bolts—they jostle for attention.
And the washers? They’re like tiny time-traveling saucers, ready to stabilize your contraptions.
