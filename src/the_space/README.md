# The Space

Maker Space is split into four main locations/sections:

- [Ground floor corridor](./ground_floor_corridor.md)
- [Ground floor workshop](./ground_floor_workshop.md)
- [South/tall/big basement workshop](./south_basement_workshop.md)
- [North/short/small basement workshop](./north_basement_workshop.md)

Prepare yourself for a Microsoft Copilot guided tour through our space.

Pretty much all of the text in the above pages was generated by asking Copilot to "in the style of an estate agent, describe [very brief description of what is in the accompanying photo] in a hackspace".
The relevant, mostly correct, appropriate, amusing, (and if you are really lucky) actually helpful parts of the response were then selected and made into a mostly cohesive bit of prose.
