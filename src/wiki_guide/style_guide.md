# Wiki style guide

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

- File and directory names must be [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
- Text should be formatted as one sentence per line (i.e. a newline should always follow a `.`)
- Each document must make correct use of headings, i.e. `#` as the document title, incrementing by one (`##`, `###`, ...) for each subsequent level of nesting desired
- Unless referenced elsewhere, photos should be either in the same directory as the document that references them or in a directory named `images` in the same directory as the document that references them
- Photos should be cropped to only show what is relevant to the document
- Photos should be of an appropriate resolution (i.e. high enough to resolve sufficient detail, but low enough to not be excessive in size or page load time)
