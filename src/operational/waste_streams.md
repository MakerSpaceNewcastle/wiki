# Waste Streams

We produce some waste in Maker Space, this needs to be removed to keep the space tidy.
The building does not have a commercial waste collection, so waste must be removed by members.

## Disposal streams

This is how to dispose of things that are no longer of any use within Maker Space.

### General waste

There are several general waste bins throughout the space.
Unless a bin is labelled otherwise, assume it is for general waste.

Anything placed in these bins will likely end up in landfill.

### Common recycling

There are recycling bins near the door to the goldfish bowl in the main space.
These are clearly labelled.
Please READ THE LABELS, and put things in the correct state in the correct bins.

### Wood

There is a box on the floor next to the laser cutter for wood waste.
This is taken to a recycling centre and likely ends up in an incinerator.
Use this for scraps that are likely to no longer be of use.

### PLA

There is a red sweet box on the 3D printing station where scraps of PLA can be deposited and shipped away for recycling.
Ensure only PLA goes into this container.

You may also drop unwanted or failed PLA prints into this box.

### Batteries

There is a small tub near the common recycling bins that expired single use batteries can be left in.
Should this tub be full, please take the contents to Tesco (or your major supermarket of choice) where they should have a bin to recycle them.

Other batteries (i.e. those you cannot take to a supermakret) should be taken home and disposed of yourself.

### Anything else?

Anything not explicitly listed above that needs to be disposed of must be taken out of the space by whoever created the waste.

## Reuse streams

Some things can be reused within Maker Space.

### Wood

There are several bins in the south basement workshop for wood scraps.
They are for scraps that may be of use for shims, sacrificial parts/supports, push sticks, paint stirrers, etc.

### Laser suitable materials

There is a large box on the table next to the laser cutter where material offcuts that may still be of some use may be left.

Suitable scraps include:

- small sections which may be used for inductions
- moderately sized sections which may be enough for small jobs
- unusual materials that others may want to try before committing to purchasing
