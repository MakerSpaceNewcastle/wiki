# Main Workshop Air Exchange

There is an air extraction fan for the main space fitted above the front door.
The control for it is located in the south west corder of the ground floor main workshop.
It is recommended to open a window in the goldfish bowl when this fan is in use to enable the most effective air exchange throughout the main workshop.

This fan can be used to maintain the main workshop at a comfortable balance of temperature and air quality.
