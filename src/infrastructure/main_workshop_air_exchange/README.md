# Main Workshop Air Exchange

There is an air extraction fan for the main space fitted above the front door.
The control for it is located in the south west corder of the ground floor main workshop.

When operated, the negative pressure in the room draws in fresh air from whatever source is available.
Such sources include:

- The ceiling vent above the inner door, via the ceiling void, eventually feeding from the vents in the boiler room
- Any open windows (e.g. in the goldfish bowl)
- Via other routes through the building when the inner door is held open (e.g. via Vane or the rear/courtyard door)

This fan can be used to maintain the main workshop at a comfortable balance of temperature and air quality.
