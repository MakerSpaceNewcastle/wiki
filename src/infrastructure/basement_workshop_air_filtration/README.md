# Basement Workshop Air Filtration

Both the north and south basement workshops have Axminster air particle filters.
These are suitable for removing the worst of suspended dust from the air.

They are not helpful for very fine or hazardous dust/particles/fibres (i.e. anything you would usually use a HEPA filter or class H vacuum for).

## Essential Information

- Responsible Person(s): Dan Nixon

## Instructions for use

If the air quality feels a bit shit, or you are about to do/doing something that will make it worse, then push the "Start" button on the control panel in the appropriate workshop.

The air filter will run for 20 minutes, after which it will turn itself off (**do not turn power to the air filter off!**).
At any point the time may be extended by pressing the "Start" button again.

If desired, the fan speed can be changed by pressing the "Speed" button on the panel.

As a general rule, an air filter should be used when using any of the following machines/tools:

- Bandsaw
- Belt sander (free standing or handheld)
- Chop saw
- Track saw
- Workbee CNC
- Router (in table or handheld)
