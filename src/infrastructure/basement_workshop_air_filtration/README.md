# Basement Workshop Air Filtration

Both the north and south basement workshops have Axminster air particle filters.
These are suitable for removing the worst of suspended dust from the air.

They are not helpful for particularly fine or hazardous dust/particles/fibres (i.e. anything you would usually use a HEPA filter or class H vacuum for).

## Essential Information

- Responsible Person(s): Dan Nixon

## North Workshop Filter

Currently the filter in the north basement workshop is serviceable.

It is effectively stock and located in the position it will remain in.

Please use it when creating dust in the north workshop (e.g. when running the Workbee CNC router).

## South Workshop Filter

Currently the filter in the south basement workshop is serviceable.

It is operated by presence in the basement and will turn off 5 minutes after the basement has been vacated (or everyone stops moving, for whatever reason...).

Nothing needs to be done with the filter, it will just work.

## To Do

- New control system, with:
    - network remote control
    - automatic start/stop based on presence and/or air quality
- Install new control system, in
    - south workshop filter
- Mount south workshop filter overhead in a suitable central location
