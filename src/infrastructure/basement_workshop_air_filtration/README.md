# Basement Workshop Air Filtration

Both the north and south basement workshops have Axminster air particle filters.
These are suitable for removing the worst of suspended dust from the air.

They are not helpful for particularly fine or hazardous dust/particles/fibres (i.e. anything you would usually use a HEPA filter or class H vacuum for).

## Essential Information

- Responsible Person(s): Dan Nixon

## North Workshop Filter

Currently the filter in the north basement workshop is serviceable.

It is operated automatically when the air quality is determined to be "shit".

Nothing needs to be done with the filter, it will just work.

## South Workshop Filter

Currently the filter in the south basement workshop is serviceable.

It is operated automatically when the air quality is determined to be "kinda bad" and the south basement is occupied.
It will also run when the south basement is unoccupied, yet the air quality is "shit".

Nothing needs to be done with the filter, it will just work.

## To Do
