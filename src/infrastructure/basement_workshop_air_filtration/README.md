# Basement Workshop Air Filtration

Both the north and south basement workshops have Axminster air particle filters.
These are suitable for removing the worst of suspended dust from the air.

They are not helpful for particularly fine or hazardous dust/particles/fibres (i.e. anything you would usually use a HEPA filter or class H vacuum for).

## Essential Information
