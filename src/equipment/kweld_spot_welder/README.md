# KWeld spot welder

The KWeld spot welder is ideal for welding up Lithium Ion Batteries (eg 18650) cells into battery packs.

Makerspace has the full mains powered version (donated by David Pye).  It consists of the KWeld device, the kSupply PSU adaptor and the KCap supercapacitor bank to provide the power for spot welding.

It is capable of spot welding up to 0.3mm Nickel strips.

The space has a small amount of 0.2mm nickel strip, some spot-weldable battery tags as well as the paper discs to be fitted under 18650 cell ends to reduce the shorting risk when packs are assembled.
