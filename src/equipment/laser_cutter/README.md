To the left of the machine there is a black table.
This can be used for material preparation, finishing and sorting of machined pieces.
If you have machined anything particularly smelly, as a courtesy to other members, please do your finishing/sorting on this table and do not bring it into the main workshop.

To the right of the machine on the small table (under the PC shelf) is a waste bin for scraps that are no longer wanted but still potentially useful.
To the left of the machine on the floor is a bin for waste wood scraps that are not feasibly useful any longer.
