# Setting up LightBurn on your own laptop

It is possible to use your own laptop for preparing jobs and running the laser cutter.
To do so, you will need LightBurn installed and licensed and the configuration for the laser cutter installed.

When operating the laser cutter, simply plug the USB cable into your laptop.
Remember to plug it back into the communal laptop once you are finished (i.e. leave things how you found them).

## Process

It is assumed that you have not previously installed LightBurn on the target laptop.
If you have then you more than likely do not need this guide, can download the device profile file from step 2 and go on your merry way.

1. Install LightBurn from [here](https://lightburnsoftware.com/).
1. Download [`device_profile.lbdev`](https://github.com/MakerSpaceNewcastle/Hoshiguma/blob/main/configs/device_profile.lbdev).
1. Launch LightBurn.
1. Either activate the trial or purchase your own suitable license and activate that (see note below).
1. When prompted to add a machine, import the file downloaded in step 2.
1. You should now have a machine named Hoshiguma available, use this when you want to prepare or machine jobs on this laser.

## License requirement

Hoshiguma uses a Ruida controller, so is therefore a DSP machine in the eyes of LightBurn.

You will need either a DSP or DSP + Galvo license, or purchase the DSP addon.
If you are purchasing a license with the discount code (see below), you should purchase a DSP license.

## LightBurn discount

We (Maker Space) have a code for discounted Light Burn licenses for members.
If you would like one, ask the person who did your laser training.

Note that the license is only to be using with the laser cutter in Maker Space.
Should you need to use other machines you should pay for a full license.
