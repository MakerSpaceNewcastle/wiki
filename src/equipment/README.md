# Equipment

Here you will find an overview of the equipment available at Maker Space.

Larger, more complex or more significant items are listed, by area, below.
A more complete, yet with less information, list of things we have can be found [here](./abridged_list.md).

Equipment is typically listed with a list of responsible person(s).
These people are who you should seek advice of with regards to induction requests, reporting faults and discussing alteration/upgrades.
Do not attempt to modify or repair a piece of equipment without prior discussion/approval/understanding of the people responsible for the equipment in question.

## Access controlled equipment

Certain items in the space are fitted with [RFID access controllers](../infrastructure/rfid_access_controllers/).
These ensure that only members who are sure of their own competence in using a specific piece of equipment can use them.

In order to gain access to a piece of equipment, a responsible person for that machine will have to verify that you are sure of how to operate the equipment safely.
More information about the skills and knowledge you will be required to demonstrate can be found on the page for that machine.
